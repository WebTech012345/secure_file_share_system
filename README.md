
# Secure File Sharing System

A secure file sharing system built with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Multer for file uploads, and bcrypt for password hashing. This system allows users to securely upload files, share them using a link, and optionally set a password for additional security.

## Features
- **File Upload**: Upload files securely using the drag-and-drop interface or file selector.
- **Password Protection**: Option to add a password to protect the file.
- **Download Tracking**: Track how many times a file has been downloaded.
- **File Sharing**: Generate shareable links for downloading files.

## Tech Stack
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- Multer (for file handling)
- bcrypt (for password hashing)
- EJS (for templating)

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
Ensure that you have the following installed on your system:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (Ensure MongoDB is running locally or use a cloud MongoDB service like MongoDB Atlas)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Comes with Node.js)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/WebTech012345/secure_file_share_system.git

cd secure-file-sharing-system
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
Once inside the project directory, install the required dependencies by running:
```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3: Setup Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following variables:
```bash
DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database-name
PORT=3000
```
Replace `your-database-name` with your MongoDB database name. Ensure MongoDB is running locally or connect to a remote MongoDB instance.

### Step 4: Run the Application
To start the application, run:
```bash
npm run myserver
```
This will run the server on the port specified in the `.env` file (default is 3000).

### Step 5: Access the Application
Open your web browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

You should now see the file-sharing system interface.

### Step 6: Upload and Share Files
1. Drag and drop a file into the upload area or select a file from your system.
2. Optionally, add a password to secure the file.
3. Once uploaded, you'll be given a shareable link that you can send to others.

### Step 7: Download Files
- Click the shared link or go to `http://localhost:3000/file/:id`.
- If the file is password protected, enter the password to download the file.
